Kubernetes deployment strategies
================================

> In Kubernetes there are a few different ways to release an application, you have
to carefully choose the right strategy to make your infrastructure resilient.

- [recreate](recreate/): terminate the old version and release the new one
- [ramped](ramped/): release a new version on a rolling update fashion, one
  after the other
- [blue/green](blue-green/): release a new version alongside the old version
  then switch traffic
- [canary](canary/): release a new version to a subset of users, then proceed
  to a full rollout
- [a/b testing](ab-testing/): release a new version to a subset of users in a
  precise way (HTTP headers, cookie, weight, etc.). This doesnâ€™t come out of the
  box with Kubernetes, it imply extra work to setup a smarter
  loadbalancing system (Istio, Linkerd, Traeffik, custom nginx/haproxy, etc).
- [shadow](shadow/): release a new version alongside the old version. Incoming
  traffic is mirrored to the new version and doesn't impact the
  response.

## Getting started

These examples were created and tested on [Minikube](http://github.com/kubernetes/minikube)
running with Kubernetes v1.25.2 and [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) running
with Kubernetes 1.23.6.

On MacOS the hypervisor VM does not have external connectivity so docker image pulls
will fail. To resolve this, install another driver such as
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and add `--vm-driver virtualbox`
to the command to be able to pull images.

```
$ minikube start --kubernetes-version v1.25.2 --memory 8192 --cpus 2
```

## Visualizing using Prometheus and Grafana

The following steps describe how to setup Prometheus and Grafana to visualize
the progress and performance of a deployment.

### Install Helm3

To install Helm3, follow the instructions provided on their
[website](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/releases).

### Install Prometheus

```
$ helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus \
    --create-namespace --namespace=monitoring \
    -f prometheus-override.yaml
```

### Install Grafana

```
$ helm install grafana \
    --namespace=monitoring \
    --set=adminUser=admin \
    --set=adminPassword=admin \
    --set=service.type=NodePort \
    grafana/grafana
```

### Setup Grafana

Now that Prometheus and Grafana are up and running, you can access Grafana:

```
$ minikube service grafana -n monitoring
```

To login, username: `admin`, password: `admin`.

Then you need to connect Grafana to Prometheus, to do so, add a DataSource:

```
Name: prometheus
Type: Prometheus
Url: http://prometheus-server
Access: Server
```

Create a dashboard with a Time series or import
the [JSON export](grafana-dashboard.json) - update the UID first of the Prometheus source. Use the following query:

```
sum(rate(http_requests_total{app="my-app"}[2m])) by (version)
```

Since we installed Prometheus with default settings, it is using the default scrape
interval of `1m` so the range cannot be lower than that.

To have a better overview of the version, add `{{version}}` in the legend field.
